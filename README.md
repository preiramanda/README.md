# Hey there! My name is Amanda 👋

For over 7 years, I've been diving into the world of data as an analyst, and now I'm on a mission to level up as a data engineer. 


Throughout my career, I've contributed to diverse startups such as Nubank, Farfetch, and Glovo, specializing in the Payments and Fintech sectors. 

I am diving deep into problem-solving and crafting value in every single project. Additionally, I'm spreading the data love as an analytics instructor in different bootcamps and courses worldwide! 🌐✨

I'm both Brazilian and Portuguese, currently residing in Spain. Feel free to connect in English, Portuguese or Spanish, via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandacpereira/).

Cheers! 🚀
